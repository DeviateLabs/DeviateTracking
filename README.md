Facebook Conversion API (CAPI) solution in the form of a simple-to-use Google Tag Manager extension that empowers you to track users including iOS users in Facebook ads. 


It is a serverless way to send conversion data through GTM to be sent through Facebook’s Conversions API which is a new and improved version of the Server Side API (SSAPI). It’s designed to be the Facebook tracking solution to the release of iOS 14.5 which in essence restricted tracking on Apple devices. It’s powerful, offering many of the advanced features marketers want, while simple to use, not needing any coding or server configuration. And it imports directly into your GTM.


Now you can get all the benefits of server side conversion data without having to go through the nerve-racking hassle of configuring and maintaining a server. Increase your conversions and lower your ad costs without any coding needed and no nerve-racking uncertainty on any website.

Features:


SIMPLE POINT & CLICK GOOGLE TAG MANAGER INTEGRATION

Every marketer knows how powerful Google Tag Manager (GTM) is when it comes to implementing tracking. Its flexibility and ease-of-use while allowing for compatibility and interfacing across various platforms are unparalleled.


Deviate Tracking leverages GTM and integrates with it seamlessly – affording users total control over their CAPI tracking right inside GTM while providing a “point and click” CAPI solution.


SEAMLESS SERVER-LESS FACEBOOK CAPI EXPERIENCE

CAPI expects you to configure your own server, code the proper scripts, and maintain the ecosystem in order to get good tracking data. This requires more technical knowledge than most can handle.


With Deviate Tracking, we take care of the technical side of CAPI so you don’t ever have to worry about servers and coding; you can stay focused on your marketing and business.


DIRECT CONNECTION WITH FACEBOOK BUSINESS MANAGER & PIXEL

Deviate Tracking protocol synchronizes with your Facebook business manager and Facebook pixel. Data is passed exactly as they are received by your website as they happen. There is no “middleman” delaying, manipulating, or truncating your valuable tracking data.


Your data stays unadulterated – as they should be – as they feed back into your Facebook campaigns.


BYPASSES APPLE’S IOS 14 RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP YOUR TRACKING INTACT

Deviate Tracking was designed with Apple’s iOS 14 in mind… iOS 14 made it nearly impossible to track Apple users with conventional means. We changed that. By taking over the server-side tracking, Deviate Tracking wrestles the power away from Apple and gives it back to business owners and marketers.


COMPATIBLE WITH DESKTOP & MOBILE (APPLE & ANDROID)

Deviate Tracking works on all proper devices including both desktop and mobile. It works just as well on Android devices is it does on Apple. So you can rest assured that Deviate Tracing provides you maximum tracking coverage.


ADVANCED TRACKING OPTIONS OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE VIA PARTNER INTEGRATION

Unlike the native partner integrations in Facebook that limits you to the type of events you are allowed to track, Deviate Tracking has no limits. You have full access to the Facebook’s entire repertoire of tracking capabilities. This allows you to craft powerful and in-depth conversion events designed to increase your marketing’s ROI.
